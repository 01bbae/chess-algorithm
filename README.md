# Making Chess Engines for Human Interpretation

## Introduction

The game of Chess has changed dramatically throughout the bountiful years that it has been played all over the world. Movies and other forms of media have popularized the game, while mathematicians, strategists, among some of the smartest individuals have played and revolutionized the game that we know it. Players have analyzed advances or withdrawals and have memorized and choreographed counterplays to specific moves made during matches. Some are even able to foresee moves that their opponents will make. One, two, three moves in the future have already been planned, allowing for them to make the perfect adjustments. With these tools in their arsenal, it wouldn't be long until a player takes complete domination over the game. However, these players (even though they reign amongst the best) are still human and are very capable of making human errors during a game. So, what if they were against a computer that isn't able to?

The idea of a combination of Chess and Artificial Intelligence isn't unheard of. In the 1950s, Alan Turing began the process of writing a computer program that was able to simulate a game of chess. Within the same year, Claude Shannon wrote a paper about plans to make the program eventually be able to play "good" chess. However, due to the limitations of computers, it was difficult not to underestimate the idea which seemed like a pipedream. Chess programs kept on getting beaten by human players since then and while the computer programs would sometimes get a win or tie, it was never any real contest. It allowed for newer players to quickly learn the game but proved to be no match for any decent player. It wasn't until recently, when a tournament of two dozen Chess players from around the world would compete in such a memorable event. The matches were being live streamed on Twitch and after about a month of playing, there was one clear winner: Stockfish, "the strongest chess computer to date."

## Description/Motivation

It was a unanimous decision that we were all interested in learning more about the incredible works of the chess engine that is called Stockfish. As we diligently researched about the topic, we all kept looping back to the same idea. Although the chess engines today are compelling and can easily beat the best players in the world, they donâ€™t necessarily help with allowing users to learn from the moves. They are sometimes too abstract in the sense that a human would never play that certain move. Which led us to this idea.

The motivation for modifying a chess algorithm to generate "good-enough" moves instead of solely the best move is to enhance the player experience and offer a more diverse set of gameplay scenarios. Current chess engines, such as Stockfish, use algorithms like alpha-beta pruning and minimax to select the optimal move based on factors like material advantage, piece mobility, and king safety. While this approach has led to powerful and reliable chess engines, it may be problematic for players who want to learn while playing.

By introducing a chess algorithm that generates multiple viable moves, players have a broader range of options to choose from, allowing them to select moves that align with their play-style and chess openings. Although these moves may not be the absolute best, they are still strategically sound and can offer a unique gameplay experience. Additionally, playing against a chess engine that does not always choose the optimal move may make the game more challenging and enjoyable.

## Literature Review

### [Computer Chess: Past to Present](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~alopez-o/divulge/chimp.html#:~:text=in%20computer%20development.-,History%20of%20Computer%20Chess,program%20with%20pencil%20and%20paper)

Before diving into a topic one hardly knows anything about, it is best to familiarize with the content and rich history of it first. This article gives a vital yet brief coverage of how Chess is linked with the idea of machine learning and artificial intelligence. It also allows readers who are new to the topic to easily digest the content as it isn't as dense as some others. It goes over the theory of games and introduces ideas of how computers play chess (which is through specific algorithms). If there is anybody new to the topic of AI, we recommend you start with this article and allow your curiosity to continue from there. 

### [Can Chess Survive Artificial Intelligence](https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/can-chess-survive-artificial-intelligence)

Although this article reads more like a narrative, it is still quite insightful. Of course it is critical to focus on the technical aspect of a project, this article allowed us to step back and view it as an opportunity to help people (chess players of all levels) or rather allowed us see the bigger picture. The article talks about chess engines and possibly how they are taking over, but does not view this necessarily as a negative aspect. In fact, the article introduced us to an idea some of us have not heard of -- Centaur Chess. This, like several other articles, inspired us to work on this project as whole.

### [Chess AI: Competing Paradigms for Machine Intelligence](https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/24/4/550)

This article was necessary for us to proceed with our project. It takes one of the most famously studied chess endgames and places it into several chess engines to see how each would respond to it differently. Not only does it show how they solved it, the article talks about what methods were explicitly used. Since we were using Stockfish's engine we were mainly focused on that aspect and how they were using the alpha-beta pruning search algorithm and how exactly it was improving minimax searches, but if anybody is taking a look at our project and would like to expand on the idea, we highly recommend taking a look at this article.

## Setup

1. Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed
2. git clone this repository
3. pip install chess
4. If you have a Mac, do 'brew install stockfish'. cd into /usr/local/Cellar/stockfish/{version}/bin. Copy the stockfish executable into the project directory.
5. cd into this repository directory. Run main.py

## Running the Code

#### Using a default position

1. Change your directory to the "chess-algorithm" directory. Run the code normally like how you would start a python project. In my case, I ran it as:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
2. Follow the prompt and fill in the choices that you would like to see for example:
   ```
   Enter FEN to analyze (Press enter to use default initial chess position): 
   Enter depth to analyze (WARNING: having a large depth might crash your computer. We recommend having depth of 2 or 3): 2 
   Enter number of branches to analyze (WARNING: having a large number of branches might crash your computer. We recommend having depth of less than 10): 3
   ```
   In the example above, I decided to use the default initial chess position while analyzing a depth of 2 and 3 branches.

3. Again, follow the prompt and fill in the choices that you would like to see for example:
   ```
   ================================================================
   What would you like to do:
   1. Get evaluation of the current position using Stockfish
   2. Get the best next move in the current position
   3. Exit program
   ================================================================
   Enter choice number: 2
   +34
   +34
   +44
   r n b q k b n r
   p p p p p p p p
   . . . . . . . .
   . . . . . . . .
   . . . . . . . .
   . . P . . . . .
   P P . P P P P P
   R N B Q K B N R
   Score:  3
   Eval:  +8
   ```

### Using a FEN code

1. If you would like to use a FEN code to use the program the instructions are just the same except input a FEN code. If you do not know what that is, there is more information [here](https://www.chess.com/terms/fen-chess). Just paste a FEN code when prompted, for example:
   ```
   Enter FEN to analyze (Press enter to use default initial chess position): rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2
   Enter depth to analyze (WARNING: having a large depth might crash your computer. We recommend having depth of 2 or 3): 2
   Enter number of branches to analyze (WARNING: having a large number of branches might crash your computer. We recommend having depth of less than 10): 4
   ```
   Here, we are using the code, [rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsyth%E2%80%93Edwards_Notation#:~:text=Forsyth%E2%80%93Edwards%20Notation%20(FEN),game%20from%20a%20particular%20position.), in order to see what move to make next with a depth of 2 and 4 branches total.

2. Just like before, follow the prompt in order to view what you would like to see. In this example we picked option 2 and viewed these results:
   ```
   +80
   +80
   +712
   +712
   r . b q k b n r
   p p . p p p p p
   . . n . . . . .
   . . p . . . . .
   . . . . P . . .
   . . . . . N . .
   P P P P . P P P
   R N B Q K B . R
   Score:  4
   Eval:  +30
   ```

## Future Development / Final Words

Overall, we are proud of what we have accomplished in our project. Unfortunately, most of the time spent was doing research as the game of Chess and AI are such dense subjects. Although we did not progress as far as we had hoped, perhaps we can offer some words of advice and tips for future groups that are interested in continuing our work. Testing could prove to be useful (we did not get to try a wide audience and mostly just tested it ourselves) if tested with players that actually know the game. Testing different random positions and allowing the chess engine to work using different choices when prompted and seeing whether or not the player is able to comprehend the move that was just played, could be a good way to test it. Furthermore, memory limitations quickly became an issue because there are just too many moves in chess. Even the best players in the world can only plan so many moves in their head; the same concept works with computers or laptops that we use. The program will run into memory issues and quickly shut the program down. We were thinking of implementing the Zobrist hashing functions in order to facilitate the need of memory capacity but could not figure it out completely (despite the fact that some of the code is in the main). Maybe a future group can focus on this and relieve our project of this frustrating limitation. Lastly, there are plenty of algorithms out there that we did not try to implement due to lack of time. An algorithm that we looked at but did not pursue is the Widest Margin Algorithm. We covered it in our Literature Review section, but just as a reminder for any future groups, please read this article, [Chess AI: Competing Paradigms for Machine Intelligence](https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/24/4/550).
